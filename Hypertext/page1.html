<p><h1><u>The Nightmare</u></h1>
  You're outside, parkouring across and climbing <i>skyscrapers</i>.<br>
  Your friend and several other climbers are there right beside you,
  <h3>cheering</h3> and <h2>hollering</h2> as they race to climb the farthest.<br>
  All of a sudden, the skyscraper you and your friend are on begins to <h1>sway violently</h1>
  and several people <i>slip off</i>.<br><br>
  Do you:
  <ol>
    <li><a href="page2.html">Hold on to the nearest ledge with an iron grip.</a></li>
    <li><a href="page3.html">Try to catch a falling climber with one hand.</a></li>
    <li><a href="page4.html">Jump down onto a nearby balcony for protection.</a></li>
  </ol>
