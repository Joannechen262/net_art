<h3><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4d9PtIEVij9jW5OaLinH66?si=30c42ac677b74323">Clara Bow by Taylor Swift</a></h3>
    [&nbsp;Verse 1&nbsp;]<br>
    <b>You look like Clara Bow</b>
    <ol>
    <li>In this light, remarkable</li>
    <li>All your life, did you know</li>
    <li>You'd be picked like a rose?</li>
    </ol>
[&nbsp;Pre-Chorus&nbsp;]<br>
    I'm not trying to exaggerate<br>
    But I think I might<br>
    <ul>
    <li>die if it happened</li>
    <li>die if it happened to me</li>
    </ul>
    No one in my small town<br>
    Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan<br><br>
[&nbsp;Chorus&nbsp;]<br>
    This town is fake, but you're the real thing<br>
    Breath of fresh air through smoke rings<br>
    Take the glory, give everything<br>
    <em>Promise to be dazzling</em><br><br>
[&nbsp;Verse 2&nbsp;]<br>
    <b>You look like Stevie Nicks</b><br>
    <ol>
    <li>In '75, the hair and lips</li>
    <li>Crowd goes wild at her fingertips</li>
    <li>Half moonshine, a full eclipse</li>
    </ol>
[&nbsp;Pre-Chorus&nbsp;]<br>
    I'm not trying to exaggerate<br>
    But I think I might<br>
    <ul>
    <li>die if I made it</li>
    <li>die if I made it</li>
    </ul>
    No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in L.A. <br>
    They all wanna say... <br><br>
[&nbsp;Chorus&nbsp;]<br>
    This town is fake, but you're the real thing<br>
    Breath of fresh air through smoke rings<br>
    Take the glory, give everything<br>
    <em>Promise to be dazzling</em><br>
    The crown is stained, but you're the real queen<br>
    Flesh and blood amongst war machines<br>
    You're the new god we're worshipping<br>
    <em>Promise to be dazzling</em><br><br>
[&nbsp;Bridge&nbsp;]<br>
    Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours<br>
    Demanding more <br>
    Only when your girlish glow flickers just so <br>
    Do they let you know <br>
    It's hell on earth to be heavenly <br>
    Them's the breaks, they don't come gently <br><br>
[&nbsp;Outro&nbsp;]<br>
    <b>You look like Taylor Swift</b>
    <ol>
    <li>In this light, we're lovin' it</li>
    <li>You've got edge, she never did</li>
    <li>The future's bright, dazzling</li>
    </ol>
